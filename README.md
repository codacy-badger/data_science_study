## Purpose

This repository stores the code I made while learning various things during the winter of 2018/19.

## File layout

* The folder *all_references* stores code snippets of concepts learned.  **Most of the work is stored in this folder**
* The folder *class_files* stores any short projects generated in a class.  Most classes do not have project files.  There is not a lot of code stored here.  
* The folder *test_files* stores data files needed for code snippets.  These are primarily `csv` files as study is focused mostly around data science topics.

## Courses Completed

### Cognitive Class - Applied Data Science with R

:ballot_box_with_check: Cognitive Class - [R101](https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/certificates/188a87f3ec2b4380944c2c38d3882631)  
:ballot_box_with_check: Cognitive Class - [Data Visualization with R](https://courses.cognitiveclass.ai/certificates/7dc9fafe65a84d8fa815f91b10a3a893)

### DataCamp

## Courses Planned

### DataCamp
* [TRACK: Data Scientist with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) [In Progress]
* [TRACK: Data Manipulation with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-manipulation-with-python) [One extra course - 4 hrs]
* [TRACK: Data Scientist with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r) [94 Hours]


## Change Log

* **2018-12-19** Pausing using Cognitive Class due to too many bugs taking up time in R with Databases course
* **2018-12-19** Try DataCamp course
* **2018-12-20** Skip *Using R with Databases* and either continue after labs are fixed or attempt to pass exams without utilizing Labs.
* **2019-01-06** After being frustrated by Cognitive Class's bugs and the cost of DataCamp, I was able to find a free DataCamp 2 month trial.  I will focus on DataCamp courses until March 7th, 2019.
